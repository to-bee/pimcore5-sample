# Marketing Settings

The `Marketing Settings` give you the possibility to configure marketing-specific settings, which are:
- Google Analytics
- Google Search Console
- Google Tag Manager


### Google Analytics
Google Analytics code is automaticaly injected during rendering the page.
This behaviour can be disabled using:

```php
<?php
// fetch the listener through container or (better) inject it as dependency into your code
$gaListener = $container->get(\Pimcore\Bundle\CoreBundle\EventListener\Frontend\GoogleAnalyticsCodeListener::class);
$gaListener->disable();
```
